# Employee Management Application

This is a standalone console-based CRUD application for managing an Employee database. The application performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using Core Java, Hibernate, MySQL, and XML. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and implements the Factory design pattern.

## Features
- **Create Employee**: Add new employees to the database.
- **Read Employee**: View details of existing employees.
- **Update Employee**: Modify information of existing employees.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove employees from the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Core Java**: The primary programming language used for building the application.
- **Hibernate**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework used to interact with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: The relational database used for storing employee information.
- **XML**: Used for Hibernate configuration and mapping files.

## Architecture
- **Model**: Handles the data layer using Hibernate and MySQL.
- **View**: The console serves as the view, providing a text-based interface for user interaction.
- **Controller**: Manages user input, processes it, and updates the model or view accordingly using Core Java.
- **Factory Design Pattern**: Used to create instances of different classes in the application.
